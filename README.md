Howdy, my name is Wooty! My currently assigned function is a Systems Analyst/Administrator for a medical organization.
Some of my related hobbies include analog circuitry, digital logic, RISC computing, shell scripting and arduino tinkering to name a few.

This repository will be primarily geared towards ARM computing ranging from guides to small patches.

If any of my work or contributions interest you, or you would like to prod my brain for information, shoot me an email:
